Project and Dissertation for MSc in Advanced Computer Science

The environmental perception ability of autonomous driving technology is greatly dependent on the environmental information acquired by various sensors, which include cameras, radars, and lidars. Among these sensors, cameras are one of the primary visual sensors. They are widely used in target recognition, lane marking detection, traffic signal recognition, etc. However, camera perception sensors are significantly affected by external physical interference factors. The occlusion of surface stains (such as raindrops, water mist, mud, frost, etc.) on the camera are directly impactful on the clarity of the image and the accuracy of the judgment by the perception system.
